# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a hash in Ruby?

  Your answer: I know that hashs have to do with classes inside of ruby. I would have to refresh my memory on the definition of hashes specifically 

  Researched answer: Hashes in Ruby hold unique key:value pairs. They help us organize AND create data. They are similar to arrays except that instead of their values being referenced by their index, they are referenced by their unique keys.

2. What is a gem?

  Your answer:A gem has to do with the language ruby. I can't quite recall  what they do but they would be easy to look up.

  Researched answer: A ruby gem is an open source library that has ruby code inside. They are packaged with extra data. It allows a preson to access other ruby code without having to insert said code explicitly into their project.

3. What is Ruby on Rails?

  Your answer: Ruby on rails is the connection between ruby which is a coding language and rails which is a package library. connecting the two, you are able to access code and data stored in rails to use ontop on the ruby language.

  Researched answer: R on R is an open source web dev framework which provides access to alternative code for the ruby language from the rails library. Essentiall rails helps out with a lot of processes in ruby/



4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: Having a hard time remembering but perhaps it may be databases that are serperate but can be connected if need be.

  Researched answer: A relational database stores data in tables and rows and makes the data relational by assigning each row of data a unique identifier (primary key). This key can be added to a record in another table where it is called the foreign key. This key connection allows data to be easily referenced between different tables and generally results in data accuracy and consistency. Non-relational databases stores data without the use of tables, rows, or keys. The method of data storage is typically optimatized for the requirements of the type of data being stored.


5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: Primary keys help with identifing elementes inside of databases.

  Researched answer: In a database, a primary key of a relational table uniquely identifies each record in the table. Databases use keys to compare, sort and store records and to create relationships between records. Primary key are essential to databases because these keys are used to compare and otherwise define relationships between individual records. Never change the primary key after you assign it.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. REST stands for Representattional State Transfer. RESTful routes are pathways providing mapping from HTML to CRUD actions. RESTful routes include: get, new, show, post, edit, put, and delete.

2. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. Lightweight format for storing and transporting data. Often used when data is sent from a server to a web page

3. ERB: 'erb' Refers to Embedded Ruby, which is a template engine in which Ruby language embeds into HTML.

4. Params: URL Paramaters / Query strings; passed thorugh get or post request to trigger crud actions to access informaiton.

5. API: Application Programming Interface that make sense of the interactions between multiple software external systems. An API is better known as a messenger that takes requests and tells a system what you want to do and then returns the response back to you on a continuous basis. API is how we are kept on constant connectivity.
